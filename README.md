Glaucoma is a common difficult eye disease with intermittent or continuous elevation of intraocular pressure. The disease is rapid and harmful, and can lead to blindness at any time. Sustained high intraocular pressure can cause damage to all parts of the eyeball, resulting in atrophy of the optic nerve, narrowing of the visual field, loss of vision, and blindness sooner or later. Complete blindness occurs 24-48 hours after an acute attack. Without timely treatment, vision can be lost to blindness. Glaucoma is one of the three leading eye diseases leading to blindness in humans. Glaucoma has become one of the serious blind eye diseases in humans, and it is impossible for patients to recur once they are blind. He called for a wide range of ways to popularize glaucoma prevention and treatment; people over 40 should regularly measure IOP for early detection and reasonable treatment.

In addition, go to the hospital regularly to check intraocular pressure, there is no better way, with the decline of vision, feel powerless for the future. With the development of technology and the cheapness of artificial intelligence prediction technology, when our eyesight is so low that we canundefinedt see the world clearly, we need the help of AI to help us live and work. God helps those who help themselves, and those who abandon themselves abandon them. With the help of the open source community, programmers and volunteers, work together to build a platform, with the power of technology, so that our future is better.
